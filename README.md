# sentinel-river-segmentation-dataset

The collection contains 2961 color satellite images of rivers located in different climate zones and corresponding masks indicating the pixels of water bodies. All images in the database are 400x400 pixels in size (they are usually then scaled during training to meet the requirements of individual models). The images used to build the collection came from the Sentinel II satellite. They were downloaded from the Sentinel Hub EO Browser online database using a semi-automated method using the iMacros add-on for the Firefox web browser. This add-on allows for the automation of web browser actions, so that the multispectral data associated with a given EO Browser view could be downloaded with a single mouse click. The water body masks were generated by thresholding single-channel near-infrared band images (Sentinel satellite's 8A band, about 864nm). The threshold value was determined automatically by analyzing the smoothed histogram. The pixel values from the 8A images were used to build the histogram, separately for each river. This is dictated by the fact that individual rivers occur in different types of climate and differ in water composition, resulting in differences in infrared band images and optimal threshold values. Smoothing of the histograms was performed using a one-dimensional convolution operation. Each histogram has a peak for low brightness values and a second peak for high brightness values. These are used in the algorithm, which finds the threshold value as the point with the least number of counts between these peaks. The graph shows a smoothed histogram created from Band 8A images for the Vistula River portion of the dataset.
